 <!-- I aim to create products that make users and clients happy. True care for quality and web standards is what has always motivated me, so I approach work through progressive enhancement. -->

<!-- I like simple solutions and try to offer a pragmatic approach when trying to solve problems. The technology should be determined by the solution not the other way round. I have strong work ethic and believe that good communication and an open mind to new ideas are key skills to be effective team players.  
I believe in test driven development, writing tests first leads to better code and less refactoring. -->
